## Overview
This project involves analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather conditions, and time of day. The goal is to visualize accident hotspots and uncover contributing factors to traffic accidents.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis can be found https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GsfNDLtJwwj-XuO4Rw00UOL2NP0lYyNe/view?usp=drive_link. \
It contains information about various aspects of traffic accidents, including road conditions, weather conditions, time of day, and contributing factors.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** 
   - Handle missing values.
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical format if necessary.
   - Extract relevant features for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize distributions of road conditions, weather conditions, and time of day.
   - Identify correlations and patterns in the data.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Create visualizations such as bar plots and scatter plots to represent the data.

4. **Insights and Recommendations:**
   - Analyze the findings from EDA and visualizations.
   - Identify contributing factors to traffic accidents.


## Programming Language
Python is used for the analysis and visualization of the traffic accident data.
